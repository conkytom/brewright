# Brewright

This program is intended to help brewers create recipes and visualize the process of a brewing session in a standardized and easily readable format. Currently, the app allows the user to create ingredients, customize their attributes, and add them to a recipe. The final product will provide predicted outcomes of the constructed recipe like the alcohol content, color, bitterness, and compare the recipe’s values to the style of beer the user intends to create. It will also provide more advanced information like water volumes and target temperatures. The user will also be able to fine tune the calculations and have access to information about what the various parts of these calculations mean, and what typical values should be expected from real world examples. The app will provide new brewer’s with helpful information about how to construct a brewing recipe, its possible outcomes, and style comparisons. Simultaneously, it will allow knowledgeable brewers to fine tune their recipes based on their experience and particular brewing system to achieve the perfect brew.
